# Getting Started Developing

To develop for this AngularJS app, you will need to run 3 things:

- A node.js server to serve the js, css, and html
- Coffee, which compiles the coffeescript source files into javascript
- Karma, which executes unit tests continuously, re-running tests any time you change a file

To see how to set these up, please see the top-level README for this project.
